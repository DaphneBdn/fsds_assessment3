    "This report seeks to describe and analyse the spatial penetration of Airbnb listings in London. After a first exploration of the datasets with visualisations that seek to quantify the current picture of Airbnb listings in London, the London wards are classified by their number of listings (low, medium, large), followed by a geodemographic classification of the neighbourhoods that attempts to identify patterns explaining and perhaps predicting the presence or absence of listings.\n",
    "What is the current picture of listings?\n",
    "Can area of London be categorised depending on the impact?\n",
    "Key findings:\n",
    "* Airbnb listings numbers are high, despite the pandemics. Compared we have xxx and xxxx. \n",
    "* X% are inactive, x% are inner vs outer. \n",
    "* As expected the most affected are these, followed by theseâ€¦ with some exeptions\n",
    "* In a more detailed geodemographic profiling of London areas the mostly affected areas are central, afluent with young population and predominantly white while the least are rural, older and no flats.\n",
